    Compute the density separation between two clusters. This is the minimum
    distance between pairs of points belonging to the internal nodes of the MSTs
    of each cluster.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array (n_samples, n_features) or (n_samples, n_samples)
        The input data of the clustering. This can be the data, or, if the
        metric is set to `precomputed`, the pairwise distance matrix used
        for the clustering.

    labels : array (n_samples)
        The label array output by the clustering, providing an integral
        cluster label to each data point, with -1 for noise points.

    cluster_id1 : int
        The first cluster label for which to compute the separation.

    cluster_id2 : int
        The second cluster label for which to compute the separation.

    internal_nodes1 : array
        The vertices of the MST for `cluster_id1` that are the internal vertices.

    internal_nodes2 : array
        The vertices of the MST for `cluster_id2` that are the internal vertices.

    core_distances1 : array (size of cluster_id1,)
        The all-points-core_distances of all points in the cluster
        specified by cluster_id1.

    core_distances2 : array (size of cluster_id2,)
        The all-points-core_distances of all points in the cluster
        specified by cluster_id2.

    metric : str or callable, default='euclidean'
        The metric used to compute distances for the clustering (and
        to be re-used in computing distances for mr distance). If
        set to `precomputed` then X is assumed to be the precomputed
        distance matrix between samples.

    no_coredist : bool, default=False
        If set to True, ignore core distances, work with
        "raw" distances instead.

    **kwd_args :
        Extra arguments to pass to the distance computation for other
        metrics, such as minkowski, mahanalobis etc.

    Returns
    -------
    The 'density separation' between the clusters specified by
    `cluster_id1` and `cluster_id2`.
